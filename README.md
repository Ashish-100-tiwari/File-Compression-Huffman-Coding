# File-Compression-Huffman-Coding
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm.  The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code.

Applications of Huffman Coding:
They are used for transmitting fax and text.
They are used by conventional compression formats like PKZIP, GZIP, etc.
Multimedia codecs like JPEG, PNG, and MP3 use Huffman encoding(to be more precise the prefix codes).


Time complexity: O(nlogn)
